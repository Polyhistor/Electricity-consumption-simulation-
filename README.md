1. Introduction
The purpose of this report is to delineate the comprehensive implementation of the proposed ‘electricity consumption simulation’ system. 
Throughout this report, various facets of the developed application will be discussed and elaborated. These facets are diverse ranging from the modeling, to object oriented concepts, highlights, and further improvements. This system has been developed underlying best practices, most efficient mechanisms, and state-of-art programming techniques that addresses requirements in an efficient and effective manner. In what follows, all the aforementioned elements will be discussed, with clear identification of strengths and weaknesses.


2. UML Diagrams
UMLs have underpinned a diagrammatic representation for specifying the object-oriented design of the electricity consumption system. These diagrams portray modeling and architecture concepts. Therefore, they’ve provided a standard development procedure by representing an overview toward development. Diagrams chosen for this system are in respect, use case diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, activity diagram, and state diagram.
2.1. Use Case Diagram
Use case diagram illustrated in figure 2-1, depicts graphic interaction among elements of the system. This use case has been utilized as a methodology to identify, clarify, and organize system requirements.
